# homebridge-http-temperature-humidity

# FORKED

Supports https devices on HomeBridge Platform

# Installation

1. Install homebridge using: npm install -g homebridge
2. Install this plugin using: npm install -g homebridge-httptemperaturehumidity
3. Update your configuration file. See sample-config.json in this repository for a sample. 

# Configuration


Configuration sample file:

 ```

"accessories": [
    {
        "accessory": "HttpTemphum",
        "name": "Living Room Weather",
        "url": "http://192.168.1.210/weather",
        "sendimmediately": "",
        "http_method": "GET"
    }
]

```


The /weather endpoint will return a json looking like this
```
{
	"temperature": 25.8,
	"humidity": 38
}
```


This plugin acts as an interface between a web endpoint and homebridge only. You will still need some dedicated hardware to expose the web endpoints with the temperature and humidity information. In my case, I used a simple NodeMCU board and a DHT11 (or DHT22). [Check my other repo for the NodeMCU code](https://github.com/lucacri/nodemcu-temperature-humidity-station).
